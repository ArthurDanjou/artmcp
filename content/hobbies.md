title: "Balance and Drive: Beyond the Data"
description: Exploring my passions outside of data science and machine learning engineering that fuel my creativity and performance.
---

While my passion for data science and machine learning engineering is at the core of what I do, I am convinced that personal balance is the key to performance and creativity. Outside of my technical projects, I nurture this balance through several key interests.

**Sports** are fundamental to my equilibrium. Playing rugby and volleyball has taught me the importance of collective strategy, communication, and physical commitment. Alongside this, as a long-time supporter of PSG in football, I appreciate the tactical analysis and performance management that occurs at the highest level.

**Music** is my creative outlet. It trains me to think differently and build harmonious solutions—a skill I readily apply to system design and modeling.

**Travel** provides me with an essential perspective. Having had the opportunity to discover highly diverse cultures since childhood (such as in Egypt, South Africa, Thailand, and the United States) has profoundly nurtured my curiosity and my ability to adapt to different ways of thinking. This is a flexibility I consider crucial in a constantly evolving field like AI.

Finally, as a **motorsport** enthusiast, particularly Formula 1, I am fascinated by the pursuit of pure performance, optimization under constraint, and real-time, data-driven strategy.

These passions are not just an escape; they reinforce my commitment, adaptability, and constant drive to progress. It is this balance that allows me to approach every new challenge, whether academic or technical, with motivation and energy.
